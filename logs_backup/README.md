# Event Logs for AG-UI Dojo ADK Bridge

This directory contains detailed event logs generated by the `agui-dojo-adk-bridge` application.

## Log Files

### 1. `agent_engine_raw_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log`
**Raw Agent Engine Responses Only**

Contains ONLY the raw request/response data from Google Agent Engine:
- Request payloads sent to Agent Engine
- Raw JSON responses received from Agent Engine
- HTTP errors from Agent Engine
- Stream completion status

This log is isolated to help debug issues with the Agent Engine itself, separate from the bridge's processing.

### 2. `events_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log`
**Bridge Processing & Middleware Events**

Contains all other events including:
- Bridge initialization
- ADK middleware processing
- Event translation to AG-UI Protocol
- Tool call detection and handling
- Events streamed to the frontend (Dojo)
- Session management
- Errors from the bridge or middleware

The logs are set to `DEBUG` level, providing a comprehensive view of the agent's execution flow.

## How to View Logs

### View Agent Engine Raw Responses
```bash
# Real-time monitoring
tail -f agent_engine_raw_*.log

# See all requests and responses
cat agent_engine_raw_*.log
```

### View Bridge Processing
```bash
# Real-time monitoring
tail -f events_*.log

# Search for specific events
grep "TOOL_CALL" events_*.log
grep "🧠\|thought_signature" events_*.log
grep "ERROR" events_*.log
```

### Compare Both Logs Side by Side
```bash
# Terminal 1
tail -f agent_engine_raw_*.log

# Terminal 2
tail -f events_*.log
```

## Troubleshooting

**Issue: Second interaction fails**
1. Check `agent_engine_raw_*.log` to see if Agent Engine is responding correctly
2. Check `events_*.log` to see if the middleware is processing responses correctly
3. Look for patterns in the Agent Engine responses (tool calls, state changes, etc.)
